The Mudd Wellness Greenhouse, or "Mudd Greenhouse" is a space on campus to provide students access to tools, supplies, and storage for all gardening-related activities. The Greenhouse stocks many commonly used tools for gardening such as shovels, soil, seeds, pots, and more. The Mudd Greenhouse is envisioned as a place that makes gardening more easily accessible to all as well as a space for the community to enjoy the benefits of gardening while studying or relaxing.
