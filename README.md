# Siena's Personal Jekyll Site
This repository contains the files for my personal website built by Jekyll using my altered version pf Phlow's theme "Feeling Responsive" that I have called "Feeling Flexible". 

My goal is to update and alter some of the code from Feeling Responsive to better match my personal style and design preferences. 

This project has been adjusted to the point where it is a working, easy-to-use template, but certain design features haven't been implemented yet. 

To see a preview in action, visit [sienaguerrero.com](http://www.sienaguerrero.com) (my personal site) or host it locally.

To host locally:
1. Install Jekyll.
2. Clone this project.
3. `cd` into the project folder.
4. Run using `bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config_dev.yml`
