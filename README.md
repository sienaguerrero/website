This repository contains the files for my personal website built by Jekyll using Phlow's theme "Feeling Responsive". 

Currently being built, so while the overall framework is functional, the design elements (color scheme, spacing, etc.) needs additional adjustments. 

To see it in action, visit [sienaguerrero.com](http://www.sienaguerrero.com) or host it locally.

To host locally:
1. Install Jekyll.
2. Clone this project.
3. `cd` into the project folder.
4. Run using `bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config_dev.yml`
