Here’s a list of mac apps I wouldn’t want to work without. These apps speed up my workflow and help keep me organized.

##Siena’s Favorite Mac Apps
This list contains 13 apps that cost ~$391. It also contains one subscription app for $3/month. In no particular order:


  
    Visual Studio Code (FREE): This is my main editor. I use it to write code and write blog posts/articles. As I’ve been learning Markdown, I’ve also been switching some of my note-taking to basic markdown documents made on this app. I have also enjoyed trying out Atom, but overall Visual Studio Code is the app I am most familiar and comfortable with using.
  
  
    Sketch ($99*): I only started using Sketch this year, but it has been super useful in designing art assets and other creative elements of app design.
  
  
    PopClip ($10): This app is so useful given that I do a lot of copy-paste while reading, writing, and coding.
  
  
    BetterSnapTool ($3): I’m the type of person who likes to leave files open at different sections of my display while working, and this app helps me keep them organized according to a grid system, snapping the edges of windows to keep them in line with one another.
  
  
    Amphetamine (FREE): This app keeps my display from falling asleep when I’m up late at night working on projects. It’s a small issue, especially since my Apple Watch easily unlocks my MacBook, but it’s a nifty feature.
  
  
    Bartender 3 ($15): I have a ton of menubar apps that I use, so this app has been essential in keeping them organized. I can completely hide apps that I only keep running in the background and toggle apps that I don’t always want to see, like the system clock.
  
  
    Wunderlist (FREE*): All of my basic tasks and to-dos, especially for daily or weekly tasks, are kept on this app so I can access it while I’m in class on my computer or on the go on its corresponding iPhone and iPad apps.
  
  
    1Password 7 ($3/month): I have been using 1Password for a long time because I have too many online accounts and passwords to keep track of. This app makes recording and looking them up so much easier. I usually hate subscriptions, but I use this app so much and I really like the company so it’s worth it to me to be break my rule of avoiding subscription apps.
  
  
    Things ($50): This is another app that I use to keep my life organized, but particularly for my projects. It is similar to Wunderlist in that it is a to-do app, but my favorite way to use the app is to outline general tasks and goals that need to be accomplished for a project rather than individual items.
  
  
    Deliveries ($5): I like to order a lot of stuff online, and this app helps me remember them all.
  
  
    PDF Expert ($80*): Apple’s own app, Preview, is actually pretty good with basic reading/printing, but if I really want to get serious with editing/marking a PDF, I’ll use this instead.
  
  
    Fantastical 2 ($50): Apple’s calendar app doesn’t cut it for me, so I use this app for its intuitive and feature-rich interface.
  
  
    iA Writer ($30): If I’m looking for a clean, minimal, and easy to use text editor, I’ll use this app. I use it a lot for free-flow writing assignments because the interface is pretty distraction-free.
  
  
    Scrivener ($49*): I’m still getting used to working on writing assignments/projects using this app, but so far I really like how it is set up for use in writing academic essays and reports.
  


##Favorite Apps by Apple
These applications come pre-installed on Mac OS, and they’re good enough that I use them often in my workflow.

NOTE: If an app is labeled ‘free*,’ it means that I use the free version but that a paid version is also available. If an app has a price with an asterisk, like ‘$5,’ then an educational discount may be available.">
