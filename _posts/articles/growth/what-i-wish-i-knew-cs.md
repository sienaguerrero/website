*Last updated: August 5, 2019*

After three years in college studying Computer Science, there's a lot I've learned, including some tools/techniques/concepts that I wish that I had learned before entering college.

Everyone learns, and grows, on their own timeline, so it is not to say that I *regret* not learning this material earlier, but rather, knowing these things may have made my journey a little easier than it has been! 

Maybe this list will give guidance to someone. As I've learned with time, hindsight is always 20-20.

### Siena's Favorite Mac Apps
This list contains 13 apps that cost ~\$391. It also contains one subscription app for \$3/month. In no particular order:

* __LaTex__ ([FREE](https://code.visualstudio.com)): This is my main editor. I use it to write code and write blog posts/articles. As I've been learning Markdown, I've also been switching some of my note-taking to basic markdown documents made on this app. I have also enjoyed trying out Atom, but overall Visual Studio Code is the app I am most familiar and comfortable with using. 

* __Git__ ([Free](https://www.sketch.com)): I only started using Sketch this year, but it has been super useful in designing art assets and other creative elements of app design. 

* __Using Github__ ([Free](https://www.sketch.com)): I only started using Sketch this year, but it has been super useful in designing art assets and other creative elements of app design. 


**NOTE**: If an app is labeled 'free*,' it means that I use the free version but that a paid version is also available. If an app has a price with an asterisk, like '\$5,' then an educational discount may be available.
