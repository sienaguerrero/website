Here's a list of mac apps I wouldn't want to work without. These apps speed up my workflow and help keep me organized.  

### Siena's Favorite Mac Apps
This list contains 13 apps that cost ~\$391. It also contains one subscription app for \$3/month. In no particular order:

* __Visual Studio Code__ ([FREE](https://code.visualstudio.com)): This is my main editor. I use it to write code and write blog posts/articles. As I've been learning Markdown, I've also been switching some of my note-taking to basic markdown documents made on this app. I have also enjoyed trying out Atom, but overall Visual Studio Code is the app I am most familiar and comfortable with using. 

* __Sketch__ ([$99*](https://www.sketch.com)): I only started using Sketch this year, but it has been super useful in designing art assets and other creative elements of app design. 

* __PopClip__ ([$10](https://pilotmoon.com/popclip/)): This app is so useful given that I do a lot of copy-paste while reading, writing, and coding. 

* __BetterSnapTool__ ([$3](https://www.folivora.ai/downloads)): I'm the type of person who likes to leave files open at different sections of my display while working, and this app helps me keep them organized according to a grid system, snapping the edges of windows to keep them in line with one another. 

* __Amphetamine__ ([FREE](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12)): This app keeps my display from falling asleep when I'm up late at night working on projects. It's a small issue, especially since my Apple Watch easily unlocks my MacBook, but it's a nifty feature. 

* __Bartender 3__ ([$15](https://www.macbartender.com)): I have a ton of menubar apps that I use, so this app has been essential in keeping them organized. I can completely hide apps that I only keep running in the background and toggle apps that I don't always want to see, like the system clock. 

* __Wunderlist__ ([FREE*](https://www.wunderlist.com)): All of my basic tasks and to-dos, especially for daily or weekly tasks, are kept on this app so I can access it while I'm in class on my computer or on the go on its corresponding iPhone and iPad apps. 

* __1Password 7__ ([$3/month](https://1password.com)): I have been using 1Password for a long time because I have too many online accounts and passwords to keep track of. This app makes recording and looking them up so much easier. *I usually hate subscriptions, but I use this app so much and I really like the company so it's worth it to me to be break my rule of avoiding subscription apps.* 

* __Things__ ([$50](https://culturedcode.com/things/)): This is another app that I use to keep my life organized, but particularly for my projects. It is similar to Wunderlist in that it is a to-do app, but my favorite way to use the app is to outline general tasks and goals that need to be accomplished for a project rather than individual items. 

* __Deliveries__ ([$5](https://junecloud.com/software/mac/deliveries.html)): I like to order a lot of stuff online, and this app helps me remember them all. 

* __PDF Expert__ ([$80*](https://pdfexpert.com)): Apple's own app, Preview, is actually pretty good with basic reading/printing, but if I really want to get serious with editing/marking a PDF, I'll use this instead. 

* __Fantastical 2__ ([$50](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)): Apple's calendar app doesn't cut it for me, so I use this app for its intuitive and feature-rich interface. 


* __iA Writer__ ([$30](https://ia.net/writer)): If I'm looking for a clean, minimal, and easy to use text editor, I'll use this app. I use it a lot for free-flow writing assignments because the interface is pretty distraction-free. 

* __Scrivener__ ([$49*](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/store/scrivener?tab=macOS)): I'm still getting used to working on writing assignments/projects using this app, but so far I really like how it is set up for use in writing academic essays and reports. 

### Favorite Apps by Apple
These applications come pre-installed on Mac OS, and they're good enough that I use them often in my workflow.

* iTunes
* Notes
* Messages
* Photos
* Books

**NOTE**: If an app is labeled 'free*,' it means that I use the free version but that a paid version is also available. If an app has a price with an asterisk, like '\$5,' then an educational discount may be available.
